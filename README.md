# pycharm-sublime-keymap
===================

This is an updated version of the Sublime Text keymap for PyCharm. I have modified it to more closely resemble the keymaps of Sublime Text for Windows/Linux. So far it seems to be the best one out there.

### Install

* Copy Sublime.xml to following directory. Please create the directory if it does not exist.

  * Windows and *NIX systems: **<User home>/.PyCharm`<xx>`/config/keymaps**

  * Macintosh systems: **~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm`<xx>`/keymaps/**

* Restart Pycharm

* Select keymap named 'Sublime' from Preferences -> Keymap -> Dropdown menu and press Ok.
